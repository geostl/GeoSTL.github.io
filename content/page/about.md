We bring together Developers, Geographers, Students, hobbyists, Data scientists, and anyone else regardless of skill level to learn and create maps. We work on group projects in collaboration with regional organizations, field collection, host mapathons, and have networking events. If you would like to host a meeting, present, or bake some cookies, we welcome the opportunity! All skill levels are free to join.
